I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Human Neuromechanics Lab (with Dr. Daniel Ferris) at the University of Florida. I previously obtained my BS and PhD in Biomedical Engineering from University of Southern California (with Dr. James Finley).

My research focuses on the neuromechanics of locomotion stability for various vulnerable population using a biomechanical and neuro-imaging approach and how external mechanical assistance or biofeedback can improve current post-stroke interventions. I hope my research could eventually improve mobility for aging population and people with sensorimotor deficits in the community.
