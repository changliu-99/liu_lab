# Our Research Goal
Our research adopts a neuromechanics approach to study human gait and balance with the goal to improve mobility for people with neurological deficits and to reduce fall risk in the community. 

# Project 1: 
Restoring gait function is a high priority for populations with neurological deficits. However, cortical contribution to gait deficits is not fully understood. Our research aims to address the critical gap to improve gait function

# Project 2: Transition from lab to real-world gait behavior for rehabilitation
One main obstacle to improving gait rehabilitation is a lack of understanding of the cortical processes responsible for gait deficits during early rehabilitation post-brain injury. However, frequent visits to the lab can be hindered by the availability of transportation and caregivers. My goal is to advance the current brain-body imaging technique to facilitate the assessment of neural correlates of biomechanical gait impairments for people with sensorimotor deficits in a portable and convenient-to-use manner. This novel technique can establish a new platform to monitor the progress of post-stroke neural recovery and expand research participation for stroke survivors to inpatient rehabilitation clinics and home-based settings. We will first acquire mobile EEG and biomechanics data while people perform locomotor tasks in the laboratory setting. We will 1) determine neural correlates of biomechanical gait impairments derived from wearable sensors, 2) minimize EEG and wearable sensor configuration needed for neural correlates during gait using machine learning algorithm, and 3) transition to a large study aiming to study longitudinal gait behavior post brain injury. I hypothesize that we can identify subgroups of post-stroke individuals with distinctive brain activation patterns during gait. This will guide clinical decision-making by providing personalized intervention targets to maximize mobility post-stroke.

# Project 3: 

## Tools
Our research uses tools such as motion capture tools and force plates to capture the kinetics and kinematics of human movement in the lab and inertial measurement units to capture gait parameters in real-world settings. We also use mobile brain imaging tools via high-density non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) to quantify brain dynamics during highly mobile locomotor tasks.

        <li>Compared to flat walking, walking over uneven terrain increased theta band power (synchronization), and decreased alpha and beta-band power (desynchronization) near sensorimotor and parietal posterior areas, indicating increased level of visuospatial attention to the environment and greater alertness to balance threat with terrain unevenness.</li>
        <li>These results will serve as a benchmark for evaluating cortical contribution to mobility deficits in older adults.</li>
