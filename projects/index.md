    <p>Supraspinal control of human locomotion using mobile electroencephalography (EEG) during terrain negotiation 
      <ul>
        <li>Led a large study on investigating brain activity during negotiation over uneven terrain using mobile imaging with EEG in young and older adults.â€‹</li>
        <li>Compared to flat walking, walking over uneven terrain increased theta band power (synchronization), and decreased alpha and beta-band power (desynchronization) near sensorimotor and parietal posterior areas, indicating increased level of visuospatial attention to the environment and greater alertness to balance threat with terrain unevenness.</li>
        <li>These results will serve as a benchmark for evaluating cortical contribution to mobility deficits in older adults.</li>
